# Complaint System Migration

## Overview
This migration adds `org_id` and `hr_email` fields to the complaints table to enable efficient querying of complaints by organization and HR email.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `org_id` VARCHAR(255) NULL to complaints table
- Added `hr_email` VARCHAR(255) NULL to complaints table
- Created indexes on both new fields for efficient querying

### 2. Model Updates
- Updated `Complaint` model in `app/models.py` to include new fields

### 3. CRUD Updates
- Updated `create_complaint()` to populate `org_id` and `hr_email` from employee records
- Updated `get_all_complaints_for_hr()` to query directly using the new fields

### 4. API Updates
- Updated complaint resolution logic to use the new fields for access control

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Migration
```bash
cd backend
python run_complaint_migration.py
```

### 2. Verify Migration
The script will automatically verify that the new columns were added successfully.

### 3. Restart Application
Restart your FastAPI application to use the updated models and logic.

## Benefits

1. **Efficient Querying**: No more JOINs needed to query complaints by organization or HR email
2. **Better Performance**: Direct field queries are much faster than JOIN operations
3. **Simplified Logic**: Access control is now straightforward using the stored fields
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing complaints are automatically updated with the new fields

## Data Migration

The migration automatically updates existing complaints:
- Identified complaints: `org_id` and `hr_email` are populated from the employee record
- Anonymous complaints: Fields remain NULL (handled by application logic)

## Testing

After migration, test the following:
1. HR can see all complaints from their organization
2. HR can resolve complaints from their organization
3. Anonymous complaints are visible to all HR users
4. New complaints are created with proper `org_id` and `hr_email` values
